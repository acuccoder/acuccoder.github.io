pixel-canvas.js, nord.css, and typed.umd.js are licensed under the MIT License. I have included the MIT License in all three of the files.
Also, my code editor automatically prettifies any code I press CTRL+S on (saving), so the file is technically changed.
fullpage.min.css and fullpage.min.js are both licensed under the GNU GPLv3, as originally stated in both files.
The rest of the files and this project as a whole are licensed under the GNU GPLv3.
